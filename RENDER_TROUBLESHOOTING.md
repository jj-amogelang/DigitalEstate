## 🚨 Render Deployment Troubleshooting

Your dashboard is deployed but not responding correctly. Here's how to diagnose and fix the issue:

### 🔍 Step 1: Check Render Service Status

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Find your backend service**: `digital-estate-backend`
3. **Check the deployment status**:
   - ✅ **Deployed**: Service should show green "Live" status
   - 🔄 **Building**: Wait for build to complete (can take 5-10 minutes)
   - ❌ **Failed**: Check the build logs for errors

### 📋 Step 2: Review Build Logs

If deployment failed or is stuck:

1. **Click on your backend service**
2. **Go to "Logs" tab**
3. **Look for error messages** in the build process
4. **Common issues**:
   - Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
   - Import errors from renamed files
   - Database connection errors

### 🔧 Step 3: Verify Render Service Configuration

**Build Command**: Should be `pip install -r requirements.txt`
**Start Command**: Should be `gunicorn main:app` or `python -m gunicorn main:app`

### 🗄️ Step 4: Database Configuration

1. **Check your PostgreSQL database**:
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Databases
   - Verify `digital-estate-db` is running
   - Copy the **Internal Database URL**

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - In your backend service settings
   - `DATABASE_URL` should be set to your PostgreSQL Internal URL
   - `FLASK_ENV` should be `production`

### 🌐 Step 5: Test the API Manually

Once deployed, test these URLs in your browser:

1. **Health Check**: https://digital-estate-backend.onrender.com/
   - Should return: `"Digital Estate API is running!"`

2. **Properties API**: https://digital-estate-backend.onrender.com/api/properties
   - Should return JSON array (might be empty initially)

### 📊 Step 6: Populate Database

Once the API is responding:

```bash
# If you have access to Render's console, run:
python production_database_setup.py
```

### 🚀 Step 7: Test Full Dashboard

1. **Frontend URL**: https://digital-estate-dashboard.onrender.com
2. **Should display properties** if database is populated
3. **If showing 0 properties**: Database needs population

### ❗ Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: 404 Error**
- ✅ Check if service is actually deployed (not just building)
- ✅ Verify start command uses correct file name (main:app not app:app)
- ✅ Check if wsgi.py is present in the repository

**Issue 2: 500 Internal Server Error**
- ✅ Check environment variables (DATABASE_URL)
- ✅ Review application logs for Python errors
- ✅ Verify database is accessible

**Issue 3: Empty Properties Array**
- ✅ Database tables created but no data
- ✅ Need to run database population script
- ✅ Check Excel file is accessible

**Issue 4: CORS Errors (from frontend)**
- ✅ Backend CORS is configured
- ✅ Check if API URL is correct in frontend config

### 🔄 Quick Fix Steps

1. **Force Redeploy**:
   - Make a small change to any file
   - Commit and push to trigger new deployment

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - DATABASE_URL should start with `postgresql://`
   - No trailing slashes in URLs

3. **Verify File Names**:
   - main.py (not app.py)
   - wsgi.py exists and imports main
   - build.sh references correct files

### 📞 Next Steps

1. Check your Render dashboard and share the build/deployment status
2. If deployed successfully, run the database population script
3. Test the API endpoints manually
4. Verify the frontend can connect to the backend

The most likely issue is that Render is still building or there's a configuration error in the service settings.
